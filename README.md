# RedXen Homepage

## What is this?
The portal for the community where everything is linked. It is supposed to be as lightweigh and well-functioning as possible.

## How does this work?
It is based around flexboxes mostly to ensure efficiency and good support.

It has no good support for inferior browsers at the moment, and not planning to support them either, gonna support only current stable versions and some previous ones if needed.

## What formats does it use?
- WebP - Images
- SVG - Graphics
- Woff2 - Fonts

## AJAX Usage
We use AJAX calls to load content on demand and not on load.
