# RedXen Homepage

## What is this?

Well, nothing special...
This is just the homepage i use for the community i am running [here](https://redxen.eu)

## Why do i host it on GitHub?

If anyone wants to contribute, see my code practices or something similar, then here it is.
It is also easier to check on something or manage changes.
